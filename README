This is an Apache::Session extension module that stores the 
session data in Shared memory (so, does exactly what it says 
on the tin then) using IPC::Cache (and hence IPC::ShareLite).


To install


  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

.. you know, the usual.


As far as I know it doesn't leak memory and is about as fast as 
Apache::Session::File, if not faster, but you don't have to start 
fiddling round setting up directories that the Webserver can 
write to but which browsers don't have access.

It probably isn't hugely scaleable. Maybe it is. I haven't had 
and oppurtunity to check. Get back to me if you find out either 
way. 

IPC::ShareLite had problems with perl 5.6 last time I checked. 
This may be fixed. If not, bug the author, not me ;)
